# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:
- Using our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary Dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib with our files city data and ride data, we created a multiple-line graph that displays a summary of total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results:
- After evaluating our data for each city type, we came to the conclusion that rural cities had the lowest number of rides but the most expensive average fare per ride and per driver. As expected, the urban cities had the highest number of rides and drivers than any other city type.

- Evaluating the data of each city type, we set the data to output the sum of the fares for each week. We were able to diplay a multi-line graph demonstrating what week of each month generated the highest fare and what week of each month generated the lowest fare for each city type. Looking at the graph, we can conclude that the last week of Feburary was the highest fare generated for the urban and suburban cities. As for the rural cities, we can conclude that the first week of April had the highest fare generated.

## Summary:
- Based on our results with the data gathered we advise a the CEO to consider increasing ride fares in more saturated areas like in urban cities since destinations may be closer, adjust fare charges based on weeks where fares generated are lower as leverage, and if possible assign or rotate drivers to different city types during certain times of the month so that all drivers have the opportunity to individually increase fare generaed.
